						<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
						<p>jpegery is a lightweight, web-based, image sharing platform with a focus on original content.
							Our primary interest is giving credit to individuals who create compelling, unique, and viral visual content.  jpegery will provide users two primary methods to discover images that appeal to them. First they can search through hashtags and users, then they can follow the tags and accounts they like the most. While jpegery may not be able to stop content theft, our goal is to make it easier for creators to get the recognition they deserve.

							<p class="text-center"><strong>Jason Holmes, 23</strong><br>Graduate Student, TA</p><br>
							<strong>User Type: </strong>Non-professional, irregular poster.<br><br>
							<strong>Goal: </strong>John has a casual interest in art, sketches of architecture in particular. He wishes to share his work for advice, inspiration, and praise. As such, he has posted content on jpegery three times, and is visiting the site to read any comments on his work.<br><br>
							<strong>History: </strong>John was born into a middle-class family. He has one younger brother who is in his senior year of high-school. Both of his parents are employed. He majored in History two years ago and is currently working on his masters. He is somewhat bilingual, being relatively proficient with Russian. His parents probably thought they were very clever and ironic when they were naming him.

						<p class="text-center"><strong>Dana McNeill, 26</strong><br>Accounting</p><br>
						<strong>User Type: </strong>Non-professional, but posts regularly<br><br>
						<strong>Goal: </strong>Following the advice of a speaker at her old University, Dana has taken to creating an image diary, drawing something that she saw or experienced every day in ink. She has posted them on jpegery every day for a bit more than a year, often providing comments describing the context of the images. This is primarily a hobby for her, and other than a vague satisfaction in how much her art has improved and how she hasn’t missed a day, she has no real goals or agendas in her drawings.<br><br>
						<strong>History: </strong>Dana grew up a military brat, living on a base for most of her childhood. She’s very self sufficient, though this is less something she intentionally pursued and more something that just happened. She’s aggressive in the stock market.

						<strong>History: </strong>Jessica is in middle school; her life is consumed by her schoolwork but mostly by her friends and her social life.  Though she has access to a desktop computer, she accesses the Internet primarily via her smartphone.
