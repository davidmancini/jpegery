				<h3>Musical Mother</h3>
				<p>Meredith has never been a fan of online shopping, but has little choice as there are not
					many places that sell music equipment in her town. When making used purchases she prefers
					to deal in person so that she can inspect the purchase and avoid waiting for shipping.

			<div class="needs">
				<h3>Needs</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A way to be able to sort through all the instruments for sale in her area
					<li>Clear description of the instrument she’s looking at including an image
					<li>Clearly marked price and an easy way to contact the seller

				</ul>

			<div class="goals">
				<p>Meredith Offner is a 35 year-old musician and single mother. She is looking for a new instrument for
					her 8 year-old son who has shown interest in learning how to play music. Money is not necessarily
					tight in her household, but she’s not one to spend more money than she needs to. She wants a quality
					instrument that her son can use to test the waters of musicianship but also something that can be played
					a comfortable volume and not annoy neighbors in their apartment complex. With quality and volume in mind,
					she has set out looking for a used keyboard or acoustic guitar.</p>
